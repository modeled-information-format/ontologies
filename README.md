# attested-pipeline-template

A language-agnostic GitHub repository template demonstrating the **attested release architecture**: every artifact that reaches consumers is byte-identical to what was validated, carries SLSA provenance and SBOM attestations that re-verify at every hop, and publication is fail-closed on verification.

A tag publishes nothing unattested.

## The Invariant

```
build → attest-provenance → generate+attest-SBOM → fail-closed-verify → [tag-gated] publish
```

No step is skippable. If `verify` fails, `publish` does not run — GitHub Actions
enforces this via the `needs:` dependency graph.

### `release.yml` — The Attested Release Pipeline

| Job | What it does | Key permissions |
|---|---|---|
| `meta` | Resolves artifact name + version from the git ref | `contents: read` |
| `build` | Builds the artifact, attests SLSA build provenance, exposes the subject digest | `id-token: write`, `attestations: write` |
| `sbom` | Generates a CycloneDX SBOM via Syft, attests it | `id-token: write`, `attestations: write` |
| `gate-sast` / `attest-sast` | SAST (CodeQL) → seam-sign verdict (`sast/v1`) over the subject | `security-events: write` / `attestations: write` |
| `gate-sca` / `attest-sca` | SCA (OSV) → seam-sign verdict (`sca/v1`) over the subject | `security-events: write` / `attestations: write` |
| `gate-trivy` / `attest-iac-license` | IaC/license (Trivy) → seam-sign verdict (`iac-license/v1`) | `security-events: write` / `attestations: write` |
| `vex` | OpenVEX disposition, self-signed (`reusable-vex.yml`, `openvex.dev/ns/v0.2.0`) over the subject | `id-token: write`, `attestations: write` |
| `verify` | **Fail-closed**: verifies provenance + SBOM + every seam verdict (sast/sca/iac-license) + VEX | `attestations: read` |
| `publish` | Creates the GitHub Release with checksums | `contents: write` — only on tag push, only if `verify` passes |

The pipeline supports `workflow_dispatch` as a dry-run: the full
build → attest → verify chain runs, but `publish` is skipped (tag-gated).

**Artifact verdicts are signed and attested at release.**
Every gate verdict that characterizes the shipped artifact — SAST (CodeQL), SCA
(OSV), IaC/license (Trivy), container-scan (Trivy image), and DAST (ZAP) — is
signed and attested at release, bound to the release subject by digest. SAST
analyzes the exact source that ships, so its verdict travels with the release
like the others. Supply-chain posture (Scorecard) is a repo-level signal, not an
artifact verdict. This template is a **complete attested reference**: SAST + SCA
+ IaC/license + VEX in `release.yml`, DAST in `dast.yml`, merge-time
SAST/SCA/Scorecard/Trivy in `quality-gates.yml`. Container-scan (Trivy image) is
N/A here (this template ships a tarball, not an image); see
`modeled-information-format/rust-template` for the containerized variant.

### `quality-gates.yml` — Merge-time gates

Thin callers of the central SAST (CodeQL), SCA (OSV), posture (Scorecard), and
IaC/license (Trivy) reusables. Each normalizes on SARIF and surfaces in the
repository Security tab; wire "Code scanning results" as a required status check
to make it a merge gate. Posture (Scorecard) lives here as a repo-level signal.

### `ci.yml` — CI + Pin Check

Includes a mandatory `pin-check` job — a thin caller of the central
`modeled-information-format/.github` **`pin-check.yml`** reusable (pinned by the `.github`
repo's commit SHA), per CLAUDE.md §2/§3 (consume the central reusables, never
reinvent them). It fails closed if any `uses:` references an action by tag or
branch instead of a full 40-character commit SHA.

### `dast.yml` — Attested DAST (ZAP)

Concrete DAST example: points the central `reusable-zap.yml` at a **running**
target (`workflow_dispatch` input `target`, default the org's deployed site),
then `attest-dast` seam-signs the verdict as `dast/v1` bound to a subject digest,
and a fail-closed `verify` job re-checks it. Stand up your own deployed
preview/staging and pass its URL. Requires the org Actions allow-list to permit
the single action `zaproxy/action-full-scan@*` (or its exact pinned SHA) — not a
`zaproxy/*` owner wildcard — since `reusable-zap.yml` pulls
`zaproxy/action-full-scan`.

## Adapting This Template

### 1. Use this as a template repository

Click **"Use this template"** on GitHub to create a new repository.

### 2. Replace the build step

In `release.yml`, find the `# ADAPT THIS STEP` block in the `build` job:

```yaml
- name: Build artifact
  run: |
    # Replace this with your toolchain's build command.
    # Output MUST land under dist/
    git archive --format=tar.gz ...
```

Examples by language:

**Go:**
```yaml
- name: Build artifact
  run: |
    mkdir -p dist
    GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o dist/${NAME}-${VERSION}-linux-amd64 ./cmd/...
```

**Rust:**
```yaml
- name: Build artifact
  run: |
    cargo build --release --locked
    mkdir -p dist
    cp target/release/mybinary dist/${NAME}-${VERSION}-linux-amd64
```

**Node.js:**
```yaml
- name: Build artifact
  run: |
    npm ci
    npm run build
    mkdir -p dist
    tar -czf dist/${NAME}-${VERSION}.tar.gz --exclude=node_modules .
```

**Docker:**
Use `actions/attest-build-provenance` with `subject-digest` pointing at the
image digest from `docker buildx build --iidfile`.

### 3. Update action SHAs

Action SHAs in this template were resolved on **2026-06-18**. Rotate them
periodically:

```bash
gh api repos/actions/checkout/commits/v4 --jq .sha
gh api repos/actions/attest-build-provenance/commits/v2 --jq .sha
gh api repos/actions/attest-sbom/commits/v2 --jq .sha
gh api repos/anchore/sbom-action/commits/v0 --jq .sha
gh api repos/softprops/action-gh-release/commits/v2 --jq .sha
gh api repos/actions/upload-artifact/commits/v4 --jq .sha
gh api repos/actions/download-artifact/commits/v4 --jq .sha
```

Update the SHA and the trailing `# vX.Y.Z` comment in the workflow file.

### 4. Update the repo reference in SECURITY.md

Replace `modeled-information-format/attested-pipeline-template` with your org/repo.

### 5. Release

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

The release pipeline fires automatically. Watch it at:
`https://github.com/<org>/<repo>/actions`

### 6. Verify a release artifact

```bash
gh attestation verify <artifact-file> \
  --repo <org>/<repo> \
  --predicate-type "https://slsa.dev/provenance/v1"
```

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the full verification guide.

## Architecture Notes

### Why fail-closed verification?

A build pipeline that attests but doesn't verify provides a false sense of
security. An attacker who can tamper with the artifact post-build (e.g., a
compromised artifact store) would produce an artifact whose attestation
verification fails. The fail-closed `verify` job catches this before publish.

### Why SHA-pinned actions?

A tag like `actions/checkout@v4` is mutable — the repo owner can move the tag
to a different commit at any time. A SHA like
`actions/checkout@34e114876b0b11c390a56381ad16ebd13914f8d5` is immutable.
Supply-chain attacks against CI/CD tooling (e.g., tj-actions/changed-files,
reviewdog) exploit mutable action references.

### Why SLSA provenance?

SLSA (Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts) provenance attestations
cryptographically bind an artifact to the workflow run that produced it,
including the source commit SHA, the workflow file path, and the runner
environment. This prevents substitution attacks where a different build
produces a different artifact with the same name.

### Dry-run without a tag

```bash
gh workflow run release.yml
```

This exercises the full build → attest → verify chain. The `publish` job
is skipped because `startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')` is false.
